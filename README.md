# Nodes-Colors-Change
## Tables with programming which allows changing their row with different colors

## Starting 📐
_Its objective is by means of `JS` to call each btn and change color when activating the assigned event `onclick ()`.
each row has a specific function which allows greater versatility within the same code_

## Deployment ✏️
_The Design is oriented to a node model which is composed of 3 rows with a sequence of (1,2,4) which color change when generating a div in each btn_
- **The first node (1) -> corresponds to the first row (Father)**
- **The second node (2) -> corresponds to the second row (son1)**
- **The third node (3) -> corresponds to the last row (son2)**
